# Rumelt's Strategy Kernel

**Source:** *Good Strategy/Bad Strategy* by Richard Rumelt (2011)

**Core insight:** Good strategy isn't about goals, vision, or aspirations. It's about diagnosing a critical challenge, choosing an overall approach, and designing coherent actions to carry out that approach.

## The Three Components

### 1. DIAGNOSIS

**What it is:** A clear, honest assessment of the critical challenge or opportunity you face.

**Questions to answer:**
- What's the core problem or opportunity?
- What's changing in the market or competitive landscape?
- What's the fundamental difficulty we must overcome?
- What constraints do we face? (resources, time, capabilities)

**Characteristics of good diagnosis:**
- Based on facts and data, not wishes
- Identifies the **crux** — the pivotal challenge that matters most
- Cuts through noise to highlight what's critical
- Explains why the current situation exists

**Red flags:**
- "We need to do more with X" (vague)
- Skipping diagnosis and jumping to solutions

---

### 2. GUIDING POLICY

**What it is:** Your overall approach for dealing with the challenge identified in the diagnosis.

**This is NOT:**
- A list of specific actions or features
- A goal or target ("grow 50%!")
- A vision statement ("be the best!")

**This IS:**
- The overall approach or method
- A choice that creates advantage
- Often defines what you **won't** do (focus requires saying no)
- Channels action in certain directions while ruling out others

**Questions to answer:**
- How will we approach this challenge?
- What's our overall method or direction?
- What tradeoffs are we making?
- What are we choosing NOT to do?

---

### 3. COHERENT ACTIONS

**What it is:** A set of coordinated actions designed to carry out the guiding policy.

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple actions that **work together** (coherent!)
- Each action supports the guiding policy
- They're mutually reinforcing, not scattered
- Specific enough to be implemented
- Resource-realistic (can actually be done with your constraints)

**Questions to answer:**
- What specific initiatives will we pursue?
- What features will we build? (roadmap)
- How will we allocate resources?
- What's the timeline?
- How do these actions reinforce each other?

## What Makes a Strategy "Good" vs "Bad"?

### Bad Strategy (Rumelt's Four Hallmarks)

1. **Fluff:** Gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts ("leverage synergies to maximize value")
2. **Failure to face the challenge:** Diagnosis missing or superficial
3. **Mistaking goals for strategy:** Ambition without method ("become the market leader")
4. **Bad strategic objectives:** Incoherent, unconnected actions; laundry lists

### Good Strategy Checklist

- Clear diagnosis that explains the critical challenge
- Guiding policy that channels efforts in a coherent direction
- Coherent actions that are feasible and mutually reinforcing
- Hard choices explicitly made (focus = saying no)
- Acknowledges constraints (resources, time, capabilities)
- Creates advantage through focus and coherence

## Strategy Kernel Template

```markdown
## DIAGNOSIS: [Challenge/Opportunity Name]

**The Situation:**
[2-3 paragraphs explaining the critical challenge you face, based on facts and competitive analysis]

**The Crux:**
[1 sentence identifying the pivotal difficulty or opportunity]

---

## GUIDING POLICY: [Approach Name]

**Our Overall Approach:**
[1-2 paragraphs describing the general method you'll use to address the challenge]

**Key Strategic Choices:**
- We will: [Choice 1]
- We will: [Choice 2]
- We will NOT: [What you're ruling out]

---

## COHERENT ACTIONS: [Plan Name]

**Q1 Initiatives:**
- [Action 1: specific, feasible]
- [Action 2: reinforces action 1]

**Q2 Initiatives:**
- [Action 3: builds on Q1]
- [Action 4: reinforces overall approach]

**Resource Allocation:**
- [How you'll allocate team, budget, time]

**Critical Assumptions:**
- [Assumption 1: what must be true for this to work]
- [Assumption 2: how you'll validate/invalidate]
```

## When to Use

- H1/H2 strategic planning
- Annual product roadmap
- Competitive response planning
- New product launch
- Turnaround situations
- Feature prioritization (diagnosis: what's blocking users? guiding policy: focus area; coherent actions: specific features)
