**Core insight:** Great product strategy simultaneously optimizes for customer delight, competitive defensibility, and business sustainability. If you only focus on one or two, your strategy is incomplete.

## The Three Pillars

### D — DELIGHT

**What it is:** The unique ways your product creates customer value and joy.

**Questions:**
- What makes your product delightful?
- What creates "aha!" moments?
- What drives word-of-mouth?
- What would customers miss if it disappeared?

**Types of delight:**
- **Functional:** Solves the problem better/faster/easier
- **Emotional:** Makes users feel smart, capable, connected
- **Experiential:** The product is enjoyable to use (not just useful)

**Measure:** NPS, retention curves, time spent, feature adoption, qualitative feedback.

### H — HARD TO COPY

**What it is:** Defensive moats that prevent competitors from easily replicating your delight.

**Types of moats (Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers):**
1. **Network effects** — Product gets better as more people use it
2. **Scale economies** — Cost advantages from being larger
3. **Brand** — Trusted reputation and emotional connection
4. **Switching costs** — Painful for customers to leave
5. **Cornered resource** — Exclusive access to something valuable
6. **Process power** — Unique processes or culture that can't be copied
7. **Counter-positioning** — New model incumbents can't adopt without cannibalizing

**Measure:** Time competitors need to replicate, investment required, data moat size, network effects.

### M — MARGIN-ENHANCING

**What it is:** Ways your strategy improves business economics over time.

**Revenue side:** Premium features, increased usage, network effects (lower CAC), better retention (higher LTV).

**Cost side:** Automation, self-service, better onboarding (lower churn), platform leverage.

**Measure:** LTV, CAC, LTV/CAC ratio (target 3:1+), gross margin, retention rate.

## DHM Feature Scorecard

For each potential feature, score 1–5 on each dimension:

| Feature | Delight | Hard to Copy | Margin | Total | Priority |
|---------|---------|--------------|--------|-------|----------|
| Feature A | 5 | 4 | 5 | 14 | HIGH |
| Feature B | 5 | 2 | 2 | 9 | MEDIUM |
| Feature C | 3 | 1 | 4 | 8 | LOW |

- **12+:** Build these first — they're strategic
- **8–11:** Consider, but evaluate opportunity cost
- **<8:** Question if this belongs in the roadmap

**Red flags:**
- High delight, low hard-to-copy = easily copied, no moat
- High delight, low margin = unsustainable
- High margin, low delight = customers won't use it
