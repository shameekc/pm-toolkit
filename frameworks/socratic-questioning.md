# Socratic Questioning for Product Decisions

**Goal:** Help sharpen feature thinking through targeted questions. Use this to move from vague ideas to clear, well-reasoned decisions.

Good Socratic questioning:
- Helps uncover assumptions
- Clarifies fuzzy thinking
- Surfaces potential issues early
- Strengthens the rationale

## The Five Question Categories

Pick the 3–5 most relevant from each category based on the feature or decision.

### 1. Problem Clarity
**Purpose:** Ensure the problem is real and well-understood.

- "What specific user pain point does this solve?"
- "How do we know this is a real problem?" (Push for evidence: interviews, tickets, data.)
- "Who experiences this problem most acutely?"
- "What's the cost of NOT solving this?"

### 2. Solution Validation
**Purpose:** Ensure the proposed solution actually solves the problem.

- "Why is this the right solution for that problem?"
- "What alternatives did you consider? Why did you reject them?"
- "What's the simplest version that solves the core problem?"
- "How will users discover this feature?"

### 3. Success Criteria
**Purpose:** Ensure you can measure if the solution works.

- "How will we know if this feature is successful?"
- "What would make you consider this feature a failure?"
- "What metric are we trying to move? By how much?"
- "What's the adoption target?"

### 4. Constraints & Trade-offs
**Purpose:** Surface limitations and difficult decisions.

- "What are the technical constraints or risks?"
- "What are we NOT going to do as part of this?"
- "What existing features or workflows does this affect?"
- "If we had half the time/resources, what would we cut?"

### 5. Strategic Fit
**Purpose:** Ensure the feature aligns with company goals and strategy.

- "Why is this the right feature to build RIGHT NOW?"
- "How does this fit into our broader product strategy?"
- "What happens if we wait 6 months to build this?"
- "How does this affect our competitive position?"

## Conversation Flow

**Start broad, then narrow:**
1. Problem clarity (ground in user needs)
2. Solution validation + success criteria
3. Strategic fit (ladder up to business strategy)

### Red Flags to Listen For

- **Vague language:** "Users want better..." → What specifically?
- **Solution-first thinking:** Can describe feature but struggles with the problem.
- **Lack of evidence:** "I think users would like..." → How do we know?
- **Unclear success:** Can't articulate what success looks like.

## Coaching Tips

- If the person struggles: offer multiple-choice options or examples.
- If the answer is weak: "Can you say more?" or "What evidence supports that?"
- If the answer is strong: acknowledge it, build on it with the next question.

## Output

After Socratic questioning, you should have:
- Clear, specific problem statement with evidence
- Rational justification for why THIS solution
- Concrete success criteria (quantitative + qualitative)
- Explicit scope boundaries (what's in, what's out)
- Strategic narrative for why this matters now
