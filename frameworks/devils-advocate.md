# Devil's Advocate Method for Strategy

**Core principle:** The best way to strengthen an argument is to attack it rigorously. If your strategy survives devil's advocate challenges, it's much more likely to survive real-world execution.

## Why It Matters

Humans naturally seek evidence that confirms existing beliefs and dismiss contradicting evidence. Devil's advocate fixes this by:
- Forcing you to confront weaknesses
- Surfacing hidden assumptions
- Identifying risks you hadn't considered
- Stress-testing logic before committing resources

## How to Play Devil's Advocate

### Step 1: State the Strategic Choice Clearly
**Format:** "I believe we should [X] because [Y]."

### Step 2: Argue the OPPOSITE Position Forcefully
**Rules:**
- Don't hold back — be brutally honest
- Attack assumptions, not the person
- Use evidence where possible
- Surface what could go wrong

### Step 3: Defend OR Revise Your Choice
- **Defend:** Address each point; acknowledge what's true; explain why you still believe it's right.
- **Revise:** Admit the challenge identified real problems; adjust; re-run devil's advocate on the revised choice.

## The 5 Devil's Advocate Lenses

### 1. ASSUMPTIONS
"What are you assuming that might not be true?"

### 2. RISKS
"What could go wrong? What's the downside?"

### 3. OPPORTUNITY COST
"What are you NOT doing by choosing this?"

### 4. EVIDENCE
"Where's the proof this will work?"

### 5. ALTERNATIVES
"Why is this better than other options?"

## Templates

### Direct Challenge
"Your choice is [X]. Here's why that's wrong: [reasons]."

### Alternative Framing
"You're framing this as [X vs Y]. But what if the real choice is [Z]?"

### Steelman Then Attack
"Here's the strongest version of your argument: [steelman]. Now here's why it still fails: [attack]."

### Second-Order Effects
"Even if [your choice] succeeds, here's the unintended consequence: [second-order effect]."

## The 3-Round Process

**Round 1:** Initial challenge — attack from all 5 lenses; defend or revise.
**Round 2:** Refined challenge — focus on 2–3 strongest objections; address specifically.
**Round 3:** Final stress test — "what could go catastrophically wrong?"; demonstrate worst-case thinking and mitigations.

## Self-Checklist

Before finalizing any strategic choice:

- **Assumptions:** What am I assuming that might not be true?
- **Risks:** What's the worst-case scenario?
- **Opportunity cost:** What am I NOT doing by choosing this?
- **Evidence:** Where's the proof this will work?
- **Alternatives:** Why is this better than other options?
- **Second-order effects:** What unintended consequences might this create?
- **Mitigations:** For each risk, what's my mitigation plan?

---

## When to Use

**Always before:** Presenting strategy to leadership, committing significant resources, major roadmap decisions, competitive positioning choices, pricing/business model changes.

**Don't use for:** Every minor decision, after decisions are final and communicated.
