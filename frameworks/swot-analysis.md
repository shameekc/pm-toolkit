# SWOT Analysis Framework

**Origin:** Stanford Research Institute, 1960s–70s

**Best for:** Initial strategic assessment, competitive landscape analysis, understanding internal capabilities, pre-planning before using Rumelt's Kernel or DHM.

**Limitations:** Doesn't tell you what to do (identifies factors only). Can become a laundry list without prioritization. Static snapshot. Best combined with action-oriented frameworks.

## The Four Quadrants

### Internal Factors (What You Control)

**STRENGTHS — What you're good at. Your advantages.**
- What do we do better than competitors?
- What unique resources or capabilities do we have?
- What do customers say we excel at?
- What's working well right now?

**WEAKNESSES — What you're not good at. Your disadvantages.**
- What do competitors do better than us?
- What resources or capabilities are we missing?
- What do customers complain about?
- What internal limitations do we face?

### External Factors (What You Don't Control)

**OPPORTUNITIES — External conditions you could exploit.**
- What market trends favor us?
- What are competitors NOT doing?
- What customer needs are unmet?
- What new technologies could we leverage?

**THREATS — External risks to your success.**
- What are competitors doing that could hurt us?
- What market trends work against us?
- What technological changes could disrupt us?
- What economic/regulatory risks exist?

## SWOT to Strategy Mapping

- **SO (Strengths + Opportunities):** "Pursue" — Use strengths to exploit opportunities.
- **ST (Strengths + Threats):** "Defend" — Use strengths to mitigate threats.
- **WO (Weaknesses + Opportunities):** "Build" — Overcome weaknesses to capture opportunities.
- **WT (Weaknesses + Threats):** "Mitigate" — Minimize weaknesses and avoid threats.

## SWOT Template

```markdown
## SWOT Analysis: [Initiative/Product Name]
**Date:** [Date]
**Context:** [What strategic decision are you making?]

### STRENGTHS (Internal, Positive)
1. [Strength 1] — Evidence: [data/feedback]
2. [Strength 2] — Evidence: [data/feedback]
3. [Strength 3] — Evidence: [data/feedback]

### WEAKNESSES (Internal, Negative)
1. [Weakness 1] — Evidence: [data/feedback]
2. [Weakness 2] — Evidence: [data/feedback]
3. [Weakness 3] — Evidence: [data/feedback]

### OPPORTUNITIES (External, Positive)
1. [Opportunity 1] — Evidence: [market data/trends]
2. [Opportunity 2] — Evidence: [market data/trends]
3. [Opportunity 3] — Evidence: [market data/trends]

### THREATS (External, Negative)
1. [Threat 1] — Evidence: [competitive/market data]
2. [Threat 2] — Evidence: [competitive/market data]
3. [Threat 3] — Evidence: [competitive/market data]

### STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS
**SO Strategies:** [How to use strengths to exploit opportunities]
**ST Strategies:** [How to use strengths to defend against threats]
**WO Strategies:** [How to overcome weaknesses to capture opportunities]
**WT Strategies:** [How to minimize weaknesses and avoid threats]

**Key Recommendation:**
[Based on SWOT analysis, what should we do?]

## Common Mistakes

1. **Lists without prioritization** — Force rank; pick top 3–5 per quadrant.
2. **Internal vs external confusion** — Strengths/Weaknesses = internal; Opportunities/Threats = external.
3. **Vague statements** — Be specific and evidence-based.
4. **SWOT as final output** — SWOT is input to strategy, not the strategy itself.
5. **One-time exercise** — Revisit quarterly.
