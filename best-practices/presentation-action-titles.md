# Presentation Best Practices: Action Titles

**Source:** McKinsey / BCG consulting standards

---

## Core Principle

Every slide title should be a **complete declarative statement** that conveys the key insight — not a topic label. These are called "action titles" because they actively tell the audience the takeaway.

---

## Key Rules

- **Length:** Less than 15 words; ideally 5–6 words. No more than two lines.
- **Format:** Active voice, declarative statement.
- **The "titles only" test:** If someone reads only the slide titles in sequence, they should understand the full argument.
- **Write titles first:** Outline your argument as titles, then fill in supporting content.
- **One idea per slide.**

## Examples

| Bad (Topic Label) | Good (Action Title) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "The Problem" | "60% of Users Drop Off Before Completing Their First Task" |
| "Market Analysis" | "Small Teams Are Underserved by Current AI Tools" |
| "Our Solution" | "Task Templates Reduce Blank-Screen Anxiety and Drive Completion" |
| "Metrics" | "Activation Improved 11pp for Small Teams in the Experiment" |
| "Next Steps" | "Ship to Small Teams Now; Hold Enterprise for Further Testing" |

## Slide Structure for Strategy / Feature Pitches

1. **Problem / diagnosis** (1–2 slides): What's happening and why it matters.
2. **Evidence / insight** (2–3 slides): Data, research, competitive context.
3. **Solution / direction** (2–3 slides): What we're doing and what we're not.
4. **Plan / roadmap** (2–3 slides): Concrete actions, timeline, resources.
5. **Metrics / success** (1 slide): How we'll know it worked.
6. **Risks / mitigations** (1 slide): What could go wrong and how we handle it.
7. **Ask / recommendation** (1 slide): What you need from leadership.

## Tips

- Lead with the most important insight, not background.
- Use tables and charts in the body; keep titles as sentences.
- Minimize text per slide: one main idea, a few supporting bullets.
- These are slide *contents* in markdown — copy into PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Keynote.
