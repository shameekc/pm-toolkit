# Communication Style Templates

Three formats for the same content, depending on audience and channel.

---

## 1. Executive Email

**When:** Strategic updates to leadership, feature proposals, research summaries.

**Format:** 3 paragraphs — Context → Insights → Recommendation.

```
Subject: [Clear, specific subject line]

[Paragraph 1 — Context: What's happening and why it matters. 2–3 sentences.]

[Paragraph 2 — Key Insights: What we learned, with numbers. The "so what." 3–4 sentences.]

[Paragraph 3 — Recommendation & Next Steps: Clear recommendation, timeline, what you need from them. 2–3 sentences.]
```

**Style:** Professional but not stiff. Lead with business impact. One clear ask per email.

---

## 2. Slack Update

**When:** Quick updates to engineering, design syncs, weekly progress posts.

**Format:** 2–3 lines max, scannable, casual tone.

```
[Opening line — what's happening]

[Key insight or decision — the meat]

[Action item or next step — what's needed]
```

**Style:** Use emoji naturally. Keep it conversational. Link to docs for details. @mention people.

---

## 3. Notion / Wiki Doc

**When:** Research documentation, feature specs, decision logs, post-mortems, process docs.

**Format:** Structured headers, comprehensive, written for someone reading 6 months later.

```
