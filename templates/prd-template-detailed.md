# PRD Template (Detailed)

A comprehensive PRD format for larger initiatives that need deeper alignment across product, engineering, and design.

# Problem Alignment

## Problem & Opportunity

Describe the problem in 1–2 sentences. A reader should be able to communicate the value/risks to someone else from this section alone.

- Why does this matter to our customers and business?
- What evidence or insights support this?
- Which customers are we working with or hearing from?
- Why is solving this urgent? Why now?
- Why is it important?

## High-Level Approach

Describe the rough shape of how we might tackle the problem. A reader should be able to "squint and see the same shape."

What alternatives did we consider? Why did we land here?

### Narrative (Optional)

Share (hypothetical) stories of what life looks like for customers today. Describe common and edge-case scenarios.

## Goals

1. [High-level goals in priority order]
2. [Include measurable (metrics) and immeasurable (feelings) goals]
3. [Keep it short; include guardrail metrics]

## Non-Goals

1. [Explicit areas we do not plan to address]
2. [Explain why]
3. [These are as important as the goals]

# Solution Alignment

## Key Features

**Plan of record:**
1. [Features that shape the solution, in priority order]
2. [Think of this as the perimeter of the solution space]
3. [Link out to sub-docs for large projects]
4. [Challenge the size — can a smaller piece ship independently?]

**Future considerations:**
1. [Features saved for later that might inform how you build now]

### Key Flows

Show the end-to-end experience. Can be written prose, flow diagrams, screenshots, or design explorations. Work with design and engineering. This section naturally becomes more specific over time.

### Key Logic

1. [Rules to guide design and development]
2. [Address common scenarios and edge cases]
3. [Include non-functional requirements]
