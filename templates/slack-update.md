# Template: Slack Update

> **Format flexibility:** You don't need to write Slack updates from scratch. Paste raw notes or reference a doc and ask the agent to generate a Slack-friendly version.

---

## The Format

**2–3 lines max. Scannable. Casual tone.**

```
[Opening line — what's happening, with relevant emoji]

[Key insight or decision — the meat, with a number if possible]

[Action item or next step — what's needed, @mention someone]
```

---

## Style Guidelines

- **Use emoji naturally** — 🚀 ✅ 📊 🔥 ⚠️ 🎯 — but don't overdo it
- **Keep it conversational** — write how you'd actually talk to a teammate
- **Link to docs for details** — don't put everything in the message
- **@mention people** — for visibility and accountability
- **Break up text** — one idea per line, use line breaks generously
- **Under 5 lines** — if it's longer, it should be a doc with a Slack link
