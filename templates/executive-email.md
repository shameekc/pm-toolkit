# Template: Executive Email

> **Format flexibility:** You don't need to draft these manually. Paste raw notes, data, or bullet points and ask the agent to write it in this format. The structure below is what the output should look like.

---

## The Format

**3 paragraphs: Context → Insights → Recommendation**

```markdown
**To:** [Recipient(s)]
**From:** [Your name]
**Subject:** [Clear, specific subject — include the topic AND the implication]

---

[Paragraph 1 — CONTEXT: 2–3 sentences]
What's happening and why it matters. Set the stage with business impact
or strategic importance. The reader should immediately know why they're
reading this.

[Paragraph 2 — KEY INSIGHTS: 3–4 sentences]
What we learned from data, research, or customers. Include specific numbers.
This is the "so what" — why this changes our thinking or confirms a direction.

[Paragraph 3 — RECOMMENDATION & NEXT STEPS: 2–3 sentences]
Clear recommendation with rationale. Timeline and resource needs.
What you need from them — one clear ask per email.

*Prepared by [Your Name], [Role]*
```

## Style Guidelines

- **Lead with business impact** — not with process or methodology
- **Use numbers** — "$450K ARR," "12/15 customers," "40% churn rate"
- **One clear ask** — don't bury multiple requests in one email
- **Professional but not stiff** — write like a person, not a memo
- **Keep it under 200 words** — executives skim; make every word count
- **Specific subject line** — "Dark Mode Research — 3 Enterprise Renewals At Risk" not "Research Update"

## Example: Feature Research Findings

**Subject:** Onboarding Research Complete — Critical Insight on User Churn

We completed onboarding research across 12 user interviews, 200+ survey responses, and a deep analytics dive. The findings reveal a significant but fixable churn driver that's currently costing us approximately $4,000 MRR per month.

The core issue: 40% of new users create solo workspaces and never invite team members. These solo users churn at 68% within 30 days, compared to just 22% for collaborative teams. The root cause isn't product quality — it's our onboarding flow. The team invite step is buried on the second screen, 73% of users click "Skip," and there's no follow-up to recover them. Users literally don't understand that the product's value is team collaboration; 34% think it's a personal task app.

I recommend we prioritize two quick wins for next month: redesigning the invite step to emphasize team value and implementing a 24-hour follow-up email for users who skip. Combined, these changes should reduce solo workspace creation from 40% to 25%, recovering approximately $24K in annual MRR. I'd like to discuss resourcing at our next sync — this is low effort with measurable revenue impact.

## Example: Meeting Recap for Leadership

**Subject:** Product Sync Recap — Q1 Priorities Finalized

We reached consensus on Q1 priorities at today's product sync. The team aligned on four workstreams: mobile app (committed), dark mode (2 sprints), template library (3 sprints), and notification infrastructure (1 sprint, async queue only). Q2 pipeline includes notification UX redesign and enterprise features.

Key data point driving the plan: activation is at 45% vs. our 60% OKR target, and time-to-first-task is 45 min (competitor benchmark: 15 min). Templates directly address this. On the enterprise side, we have 12 deals in pipeline (~$180K ARR) with 5 blocked by missing features — but the sales cycle is too long to impact Q1 revenue.

I'll have the notification PRD to you by Friday and the template library one-pager by next week. The go/no-go for notifications is scheduled for Oct 16. Let me know if you'd like to adjust any priorities before the roadmap finalization on Oct 18.

## Using AI to Generate Executive Emails

```
Using @executive-email.md, write an executive email summarizing
@[source-doc-or-notes].md. Use the 3-paragraph format:
Context → Insights → Recommendation. Include specific numbers.
Keep it under 200 words. One clear ask.
```

```
Rewrite these bullet points as an executive email to [recipient/role]:
- [bullet 1]
- [bullet 2]
- [bullet 3]
Focus on the business impact and include a clear recommendation.
```
