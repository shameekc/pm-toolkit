## Using AI to Generate Follow-Up Emails

### From raw meeting notes

```
Using @communication-styles.md, write a follow-up email summarizing
@meeting-notes-raw.md. Use the executive recap format: key decisions
with supporting data, action items table with owners and deadlines,
and upcoming decisions. Keep it under 300 words.
```

### From product sync notes

```
Write a follow-up email for @product-sync-notes.md addressed to
[recipient / role]. Focus on the decisions that matter most to them.
Include action items relevant to their team only.
```

### Slack-friendly version

```
Turn @meeting-notes.md into a short Slack update (under 10 lines).
Use checkboxes for action items, checkmarks for decisions,
and flag any open questions.
```

### Tailored for different audiences

```
From @product-sync-notes.md, write two versions of the follow-up:
1. Executive email for [leadership name] — focus on decisions,
   business impact, and upcoming decisions needed from them.
2. Team Slack update — focus on action items, open questions,
   and what the team needs to do this week.
```
