# Experiment Readout Template

Use this to present A/B test or experiment results to leadership with topline, segments, quality, and a clear recommendation.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Recommendation:** [Ship / Ship to segment / Iterate / Kill]

[2–3 sentences: What we tested, what we found, and what we recommend.]

---

## 2. Topline Results

| Cohort | Users | [Primary metric] | Rate |
|--------|-------|-------------------|------|
| Control | [n] | [n] | [%] |
| Treatment | [n] | [n] | [%] |

**Lift:** [+X.X pp]
**Statistically significant:** [Yes / No]
**Vs projection:** [How actual compares to the modeled scenario]

---

## 3. Segment Analysis

| Segment | Cohort | Users | Rate | Lift |
|---------|--------|-------|------|------|
| [Segment 1] | Control | [n] | [%] | — |
| | Treatment | [n] | [%] | [+/- Xpp] |
| [Segment 2] | Control | [n] | [%] | — |
| | Treatment | [n] | [%] | [+/- Xpp] |

**Key insight:** [Which segments show strong/weak/negative results.]

---

## 4. Quality Metrics

[Filter to activated/converted users only.]

| Metric | Control | Treatment | Lift |
|--------|---------|-----------|------|
| [Retention metric] | [%] | [%] | [+X pp] |
| [Engagement metric] | [value] | [value] | [+X] |

**Implication:** [Are we activating more users AND better users, or just moving the number?]

---

## 5. Leading Indicators

| Metric | Control | Treatment | Lift | Multiplier |
|--------|---------|-----------|------|------------|
| [Indicator 1] | [%] | [%] | [+X pp] | [X.Xx] |
| [Indicator 2] | [%] | [%] | [+X pp] | [X.Xx] |

---

## 6. Recommendation

| Action | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| **Ship** | [Which segments / conditions] |
| **Do not ship** | [Which segments / why] |

**Monitoring (post-launch):**
- [Key metrics to watch]
- [Decision criteria for expansion or rollback]

**Next steps:**
- [Specific actions with owners]

---

## 7. Expected Impact

- **Incremental outcome:** [e.g. +X% activation for target segment]
- **Quality:** [Retention/engagement implications]
- **Revenue / ROI:** [Financial impact estimate]
